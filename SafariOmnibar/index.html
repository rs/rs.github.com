    <ul class="faq">
      <li>How to uninstall?
          <p>Remove this file: <code>/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/SafariOmnibar.bundle</code>.
             Alternatively you may <a href="https://github.com/downloads/rs/SafariOmnibar/Safari%20Omnibar%20Unstaller.zip">download this uninstaller</a> and run it.</p>

      <li>How much does it cost?
          <p>Nothing, it's free and open-source. If you like it, drop me a line at &lt;rs at hackemist dot com></p>

      <li>How can I change the default search engine?
          <p>Select then right click on the text present in the location bar and select the <b>Edit Omnibar Search Providersâ€¦</b>
          menu item. In the window, select or add another the search provider and click on <b>Set as Default</b>. The default
          search provider doesn't need to be prefixed by a keyword in order to perform a search.</p>

      <li>Where are Safari Omnibar settings stored?
          <p>Safari Omnibar settings are stored in the Safari.app settings. You can <code>open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist</code>
          and tweak the values (better to do this when Safari.app is not running).  If you have troubles with Safari Omnibar settings,
          delete this file and restart Safari.app. The file will be recreated with default values.</p>

      <li>When I reboot my mac under OSX Lion with "reopen windows" enabled, Safari Omnibar isn't loaded properly
          <p>This is a known bug in SIMBL waiting for resolution. You can follow its resolution
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simbl/issues/detail?id=53">here</a>.</p>

      <li>I can't access "http://localhost", it always turns into a Google search
          <p>This was a bug in version 1.1 of Safari Omnibar. As this version didn't have automatic upgrade,
          you will have to install the latest version manually to correct this problem.</p>

      <li>When a search a single word, Safari Omnibar doesn't use the default search provider but try to access the URL
          <p>This may be because you have a domain search path configured on a domain with a wildcard
          (i.e.: &lt;everthing>.domain.com returns an IP). We're working on a fix for this issue.
