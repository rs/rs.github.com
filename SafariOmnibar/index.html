  <p>I'm glad that Apple has finally implemented an omnibar in the version 5.2 of Safari.
     I will then stop the developement of this plugin.</p>
  <p>Thanks for you great support.</p>

      <li>How to report bugs?
          <p>Our bug tracker are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/rs/SafariOmnibar/issues">Github</a>. You'll have
          to create a free Github account. Please ensure you run the very last version of Safari Omnibar and that your bug
          haven't already been reported before to <a href="https://github.com/rs/SafariOmnibar/issues/new">report a new bug</a>.</p>

      <li>How to uninstall?
          <p>Remove this file: <code>/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/SafariOmnibar.bundle</code>.
          Alternatively you may <a href="https://github.com/downloads/rs/SafariOmnibar/Safari%20Omnibar%20Unstaller.zip">
          download this uninstaller</a> and run it. Note that uninstaller won't remove SIMBL Agent as you may use
          some other SIMBL plugin and we don't want to break them.</p>

      <li>How much does it cost?
          <p>Nothing, it's free and open-source. If you like it, drop me a line at &lt;rs at hackemist dot com></p>

      <li>Why is this not a Safari extension?
          <p>Safari extensions are great to enhance sites or add toolbar buttons but are too restricted to modify Safari behaviors
          like Safari Omnibar does. To make Safari Omnibar possible, I've been forced to use something called "code injection"
          which is made easy by the <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL project</a>.</p>

      <li>What is SIMBL?
          <p><a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a> is a kind of framework to develop application
          plugins that modify their behavior in a way they wasn't designed for.</p>

      <li>How can I change the default search engine?
          <p>Select then right click on the text present in the location bar and select the <b>Edit Omnibar Search Providersâ€¦</b>
          menu item. In the window, select or add another the search provider and click on <b>Set as Default</b>. The default
          search provider doesn't need to be prefixed by a keyword in order to perform a search.</p>

      <li>Where are Safari Omnibar settings stored?
          <p>Safari Omnibar settings are stored in the Safari.app settings. You can <code>open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist</code>
          and tweak the values (better to do this when Safari.app is not running).  If you have troubles with Safari Omnibar settings,
          delete this file and restart Safari.app. The file will be recreated with default values.</p>

      <li>When I reboot my mac under OSX Lion with "reopen windows" enabled, Safari Omnibar isn't loaded properly
          <p>This is a known bug with SIMBL under Lion. Since version 1.6, Safari Omnibar is bundled with a patched version of SIMBL
          which fix this issue. If you installed an previous version of Safari Omnibar and only upgraded since then, you
          will have to install it again using the <a href="http://rsparkle.herokuapp.com/SafariOmnibar/last">installer</a>.</p>

      <li>I can't access "http://localhost", it always turns into a Google search
          <p>This was a bug in version 1.1 of Safari Omnibar. As this version didn't have automatic upgrade,
          you will have to install the latest version manually to correct this problem.</p>

      <li>When a search a single word, Safari Omnibar doesn't use the default search provider but try to access the URL
          <p>This may be because you have a domain search path configured on a domain with a wildcard
          (i.e.: &lt;everthing>.domain.com returns an IP). We're working on a fix for this issue.
